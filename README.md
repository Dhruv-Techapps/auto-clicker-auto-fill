This project uses an Nx monorepo structure:

- **Apps**
  - `acf-extension`: Chrome extension (background, content scripts, wizard, devtools, shared logic).
  - `acf-options-page`: React options/configuration page (Vite).
  - `acf-i18n`: Internationalization resources.
- **Packages**
  - `core`: Shared utilities for extension and options page.
  - `acf`: Auto Clicker AutoFill-specific logic, events, services, and storage.
  - `shared`: Integrations (Firebase, Google, Discord, OpenAI, etc.).
