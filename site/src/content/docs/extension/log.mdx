### Improved Logging System

We’ve improved logging to visualize the end‑to‑end flow and quickly pinpoint issues when something breaks.

It tracks all steps from `Configuration` → `Batch` → `Action` → `Event`.

`Action` and `Batch` are grouped for clarity. Collapse or expand groups to focus on what matters.
