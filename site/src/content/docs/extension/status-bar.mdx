The status experience now lives in the Chrome Action badge (the extension icon) instead of an on-page overlay. When automation starts, the badge becomes active and its badge text and tooltip communicate the current state. Once automation completes or is stopped, the badge is disabled and Chrome returns to its default icon behavior.

- Badge text changes to show the current phase using emoji indicators.
- Tooltip (Chrome Action title) gives the full context, including timers, batch/action counters, and retry information.
- The badge automatically resets to the default extension title when work is complete or when the automation is disabled.

> **Note:** The badge is disabled (no text or custom title) whenever the automation is idle. Launching a workflow re-enables the badge and reinstates the live status indicators until completion or manual stop.
