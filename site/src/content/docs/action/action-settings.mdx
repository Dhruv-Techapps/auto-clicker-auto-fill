These action-level settings override the global settings and apply to both the action and its add‑on conditions. If a value isn’t specified here, the action uses the global setting.

## Iframe First

If an element is inside an inline iframe, enable this to search within the iframe first and then on the main page. This often improves performance when working with embedded content.

Default: off. Applicable to same‑origin iframes without a URL in the src attribute, for example:

<Code
  code={`<iframe src="about:blank"></iframe>
<iframe src=""></iframe>`}
  lang="html"
/>

If the iframe has a URL (especially a different origin), create a separate configuration targeted to that URL.

## Retry

Retries locating the target element on the page the specified number of times. Default: 5.

**Examples**

- Positive integer in the range `1`–`999`.

## Retry Interval

Waits the given number of seconds between retries when searching for the element/XPath. Default: 1 second.

<Callout name="example-float" />

<Callout type="info">
  If not set at the action level, the global Retry Interval is used; if the global value is also unset, the extension
  uses 1 second by default.
</Callout>

<Callout type="warning">
  Set both Retry and Retry Interval together for predictable timing. A Retry Interval without a Retry count won’t have
  any effect.
</Callout>

## DOM Watcher Settings

DOM Watcher enables automatic re-execution of actions when new matching elements are dynamically added to the page. This is especially useful for:

- **Infinite scrolling feeds** (social media, news sites, product listings)
- **Live comment streams** (YouTube, social platforms)
- **Dynamic form builders** (lazy-loaded form sections)
- **Real-time chat applications** (new message handling)
- **Progressive content loading** (search results, dashboards)

  alt="DOM Watcher Settings"
/>

### Enable DOM Watching

**Default:** Off

When enabled, the action will continue watching for newly added DOM elements that match the action's element finder after the initial execution completes. Each new matching element will trigger the action automatically.

<Callout type="info">
  DOM Watcher is only available for regular actions, not userscripts. Each watched action maintains its own element tracking to prevent duplicate processing.
</Callout>

### Debounce Timing

**Default:** 500ms | **Range:** 100-5000ms

Delay before processing new elements when DOM changes occur. This prevents excessive processing during rapid DOM mutations (like during initial page load or bulk content updates).

**Examples:**
- `100ms` - Very responsive, suitable for real-time applications
- `500ms` - Balanced performance, good for most use cases  
- `2000ms` - Conservative, for pages with frequent DOM changes

### Max Repeats

**Default:** 1 | **Range:** 1-10

Maximum number of times the same element can be processed. Most use cases need only 1 repeat, but some dynamic content scenarios may benefit from allowing multiple interactions with the same element.

### Watch Root Selector

**Default:** `body`

CSS selector specifying the container element to observe for changes. Limiting the observation scope can improve performance on complex pages.

**Examples:**
- `body` - Watch entire page (default)
- `#main-content` - Watch specific container
- `.feed-container` - Watch social media feed
- `[data-testid="comments"]` - Watch comments section

### Timeout

**Default:** 30 minutes | **Range:** 1-180 minutes

Maximum time the DOM watcher will remain active. The watcher automatically stops after this duration to prevent indefinite background processing.

### Visibility Check

**Default:** Off

When enabled, only processes elements that are currently visible in the viewport. This can improve performance and user experience by focusing on content the user can actually see.

<Callout type="warning">
  Enabling visibility check may miss elements that are initially hidden but become visible through user interaction or page scrolling.
</Callout>

### Stop on URL Change

**Default:** On

Automatically stops DOM watching when the page URL changes (including hash changes and history API navigation). This prevents watchers from running on unintended pages in single-page applications.

<Callout type="info">
  URL change detection works with both traditional page navigation and modern SPA routing (History API, hash changes).
</Callout>

## DOM Watcher Examples

### YouTube Comments Auto-Like

Configure an action to automatically like comments from specific users:

1. **Element Finder:** `//div[@id="contents"]//a[contains(@href, "/channel/UC123456")]/../../..//button[@aria-label="Like this comment"]`
2. **DOM Watcher Settings:**
   - Enable DOM Watching: ✅
   - Watch Root: `#contents`
   - Debounce: `1000ms`
   - Max Repeats: `1`

### Infinite Scroll Product Collection

Automatically add products to favorites as they load:

1. **Element Finder:** `.product-card .favorite-button:not(.favorited)`
2. **DOM Watcher Settings:**
   - Enable DOM Watching: ✅
   - Watch Root: `.product-grid`
   - Debounce: `500ms`
   - Visibility Check: ✅

### Social Media Feed Automation

Process new posts in a social media feed:

1. **Element Finder:** `[data-testid="tweet"]:not([data-processed]) .like-button`
2. **DOM Watcher Settings:**
   - Enable DOM Watching: ✅
   - Watch Root: `[data-testid="primaryColumn"]`
   - Debounce: `800ms`
   - Max Repeats: `1`

<Callout type="warning">
  Always test DOM Watcher configurations thoroughly. Some sites may have rate limiting or anti-automation measures that could conflict with automated interactions.
</Callout>

## Monitoring & Debugging

Use the **DOM Watcher DevTools panel** to monitor and control watcher behavior:

1. Open Chrome DevTools (F12)
2. Navigate to the "DOM Watcher" tab
3. View real-time status and processed element counts
4. Control watcher lifecycle (start/stop/pause)
5. Monitor debug logs for troubleshooting

<Callout type="tip">
  The DevTools panel shows detailed information about each watched action, including processing counts and timing details. Use this to optimize your debounce timing and validate watcher behavior.
</Callout>

## Performance Considerations

- **Use specific selectors:** Narrow down the Watch Root to the smallest relevant container
- **Optimize debounce timing:** Higher values reduce CPU usage but increase response time
- **Monitor processing counts:** Excessive processing may indicate selector issues
- **Consider visibility checks:** Enable for content-heavy pages to reduce unnecessary processing
- **Set appropriate timeouts:** Prevent runaway watchers with reasonable time limits

<Callout type="warning">
  DOM Watcher uses `MutationObserver` which is generally performant, but watching large page sections with frequent changes can impact browser performance.
</Callout>

## Error handling

Choose what should happen if the element/XPath is not found after all retries.
