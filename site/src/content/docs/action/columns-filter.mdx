## Show or hide columns in the Actions table

Use the Columns Filter to toggle visibility of optional action columns. This helps keep the table focused while you edit. Hiding a column does not disable the feature—it only changes what’s visible.

Notes:

- By default, these optional columns are hidden to reduce clutter.
- Values remain active even when a column is hidden. Reveal a column when you need to view or edit it.
