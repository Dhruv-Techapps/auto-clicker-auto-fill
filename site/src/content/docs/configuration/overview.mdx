### Name

- **Purpose**: Helps make the configuration readable.
- **Details**:
  - Defaults to the URLâ€™s origin or base URL but can be edited.
  - Can be left empty without affecting execution.

### Init Wait

- **Purpose**: Sets a delay before execution starts to accommodate page loading times.
- **Details**:
  - Useful for pages with slow loading times or content that loads asynchronously (e.g., single-page applications).
  - Configurable based on factors like device, browser, and network speed.

### Single Page Applications (SPA) & Progressive Web Apps (PWA) Support

- **Purpose**: Automatically detects URL changes in modern web applications that don't trigger full page reloads.
- **Details**:
  - Works with navigation events in React, Vue, Angular, and other SPA frameworks.
  - Detects browser back/forward navigation (`popstate` events).
  - Detects hash-based navigation (`hashchange` events).
  - Detects programmatic navigation using History API (`pushState`, `replaceState`).
  - Configurations will automatically re-run when URLs change, even without page reloads.

### Enable

- **Purpose**: A toggle to enable or disable the configuration.
- **Details**:
  - Handy for temporarily disabling configurations without deleting them.

### Export

- **Purpose**: Export a single configuration in JSON format for backup or sharing.

### Import

- **Purpose**: Import a single configuration into the extension.
- **Details**:
  - Adds the configuration even if one with the same URL or name already exists.

### Duplicate

- **Purpose**: Create a duplicate of the configuration and add it to the list.

With these options, you can manage configurations effectively and ensure smooth automation and task execution.
