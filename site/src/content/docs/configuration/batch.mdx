## Repeat

Set how many times this batch should execute.

- Provide a positive integer. The batch runs that many times.
- Valid range: `1` to `999`.

You can also use the repeat index inside Element Finder XPath or Value using the `<batchRepeat>` placeholder. The placeholder is replaced with the current 1â€‘based repeat index during execution.

Example:

- Without repeat index: `//table/tr[1]/td[1]/button` selects only the first row button.
- With repeat index: `//table/tr[<batchRepeat>]/td[1]/button` and Repeat = `3` will iterate rows 1, 2, and 3.

## Repeat Interval

Control the delay between repeats.

- Unit: seconds (supports decimals). Examples: `0.5`, `1`, `2.5`.
- Requires Repeat to be set (>= 1).

<Callout type="info">Repeat Interval is optional. If left blank, each repeat starts immediately.</Callout>

<Callout type="warning">Repeat is required when using Repeat Interval.</Callout>

## Refresh

Refresh the page after all actions in the batch complete successfully.

<Callout type="info">The page refresh triggers only after all actions finish successfully.</Callout>

<Callout type="danger">
  **Refresh and Repeat cannot be used together Refresh overrides Batch Repeat. Use either Batch Repeat or Refresh, not
  both.**
