## Start [ Auto | Manual ]

Start the extension automatically or manually without refreshing the page.

- Refresh the target page once to switch between Auto and Manual modes
- Check the [status bar]([[docsref:/extension/status-bar]]) to confirm Manual mode
- Press `Ctrl + Shift + A` to start the extension
- You can change the [hotkey]([[docsref:/configuration/config-settings#hotkey]]) in settings

## Extension Load

## Trigger on URL change

Automatically run this configuration again when the page’s address (URL) changes, without needing a full page reload. This is common on modern websites and apps that update the screen while staying on the same page (often called “single‑page applications” or SPAs).

### When to use

- The website changes the URL as you click through steps, tabs, or sections (e.g., /checkout?step=shipping → /checkout?step=payment).
- You want the configuration to run again whenever the address changes on the same page.

### How to enable

1. Open the configuration’s Settings.
2. In the Extension Load section, turn on “Trigger on URL change”.
3. This option appears only when Start is set to Auto.

### What counts as a URL change?

Any change to the page address, such as the path (…/profile → …/profile/edit) or the query (…?tab=info → …?tab=security). Some sites also change the part after # (called a “hash”).

### Examples

- Exact page example (safe):
  - URL match: Exact → https://shop.example.com/checkout
  - Result: Triggers when the site updates the URL within the checkout flow. Keeps scope limited to the checkout page.

- Regex for a section (safe but broad):
  - URL match: Regex → ^https://shop\.example\.com/checkout/.\*$
  - Result: Triggers for any sub‑page under /checkout/ (e.g., /shipping, /payment). Good for multi‑step flows.

- Too broad (avoid):
  - URL match: Regex → ^https://example\.com/.\*$
  - Result: Will trigger for almost every URL change across the entire site, which can cause repeated runs on SPAs.

### Important: best practices and consequences

<Callout type="warning">

If you enable “Trigger on URL change” with a very broad URL (like the site’s home page or a wildcard pattern), the configuration can keep triggering repeatedly as the app navigates within a single page. This can lead to duplicate actions.

</Callout>

<Callout type="info">

- Create separate configurations per subdomain or per section/route (for example, one for app.example.com and another for help.example.com, or separate ones for /cart and /checkout).
- Prefer Exact match when possible; if using Regex, make it as specific as you can.
- If you don’t need repeated runs during navigation, leave this switch off.

</Callout>

## Hotkey

Set a hotkey to start the extension. Use one of the following combinations:

- `Ctrl + key`
- `Ctrl + Shift + key`
- `Alt + key`
- `Alt + Shift + key`
- `Ctrl + Alt + Shift + key`

See how to set [Manual Start]([[docsref:/configuration/config-settings#start--auto--manual-]]).

## Google Sheet ID

Used to fetch data from a specific Google Sheet.

- The extension reads only the targeted sheet at runtime; it does not scan all sheets in your account.
- Provide the correct Sheet ID to enable Google Sheets–based actions.

## Start Time Configuration

Schedule a daily start time for a task using the `HH:mm:ss:fff` format.

**Examples:**

- **Before 12 AM**: "08:30:00:000" for 8:30 AM
- **After 12 AM**: "23:45:00:000" for 11:45 PM

<Callout type="info">

### Important Notes:

- Execution waits until the specified time of day; it does not run immediately after a page refresh.
- Supported in Auto mode only. In Manual mode, the task is triggered by a user-defined hotkey.

</Callout>

## URL Match

Match specific URLs using either exact match or regular expressions.

- **Exact Match** : Use exact match to target a specific URL.
- **Regular Expression Match** : Use regular expressions to target multiple URLs that follow a specific pattern.

**Example:**

- **Exact Match**: `https://www.example.com/page`
- **Exact Match**: `https://www.example.com/login`
- **Regex Match**: `^https://www\.example\.com/.*$`
- **Regex Match**: `^https://www\.example\.com/products/.*$`

## Bypass Browser Default

Bypass the browser's default alert, confirm, and prompt dialogs and handle them within the main window.

- **Alert**: Bypass the default alert dialog and display a custom message within the main window.
- **Confirm**: Bypass the default confirm dialog and handle the confirmation within the main window.
- **Prompt**: Bypass the default prompt dialog and handle the input within the main window.
