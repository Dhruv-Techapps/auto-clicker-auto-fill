<Callout type="info">

**Bulk Export vs Export Configuration:**

- Bulk Export creates one JSON file containing all configurations (array format).
- Export Configuration saves only the currently selected configuration (single-object JSON).
- Imports auto-detect the file type: arrays trigger bulk import; objects trigger single import.
- Imports merge into existing configurations; nothing is fully replaced, and duplicates may occur.

</Callout>

Use Bulk Export when you want a full backup or to move all configurations to another browser/profile.

Compatibility:

- Bulk Export files (array JSON) can be restored with [Bulk Import]([[docsref:/config-list/bulk-import]]); the importer detects arrays automatically.
- If a single-object JSON is provided to Bulk Import, it is handled as a single import (not rejected).
- Imports merge on top of existing data; identical or overlapping entries can result in duplicates.
